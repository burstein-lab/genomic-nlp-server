This repository contains the implementation of *GeNLP*, a user-friendly web server to explore gene relationships!<br>
The server is based on a pre-trained published language model:<br>
"[Deciphering microbial gene function using natural language processing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33397-4)"<br>

Weights and trained model are available on the paper's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/burstein-lab/genomic-nlp).
